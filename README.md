## üßê What is this? <a name = "What is it"/>

This small script was created to create more dynamic renders and animations.

This is a script that interacts with magicavoxel via the built-in magicavoxel console to enable animation of various parameters that cannot normally be animated, such as sun position, camera movement, and more.

## üí° Requirements <a name = "Requirements"/>

- Magicavoxel 0.99.7
- Windows 10 (7/8 Not tested), MacOS (Limited functionality)

## üéà How to use <a name = "how_to_use"/>

The script uses a config.json file to know which parameters to animate.
To create a usable config, use the Config Generator that also comes with this project.
Save the config from the generator and put it in the same folder as the animation script. Open magicavoxel, then run the animation script as explained below. Now, bring magicavoxel to the foreground, and let the program run.

The renders are saved in the magicavoxel export folder.
