## 🧐 What is this? <a name = "What is it"></a>

This small script was created to create more dynamic renders and animations.

This is a script that interacts with magicavoxel via the built-in magicavoxel console to enable animation of various parameters that cannot normally be animated, such as sun position, camera movement and more.

## 💡 Requirements <a name = "Requirements"></a>

- Magicavoxel 0.99.7
- Windows 10 (7/8 Not tested)

## 🎈 How to use <a name = "how_to_use"></a>

The script needs a config.json to know which parameters to animate. 
To create a usable config, use the Config Generator that also comes with this project. 
Save the config from the generator and put it in the same folder as the animation script. Then run the animation script and have magicavoxel open as well.

The renders are saved in the magicavoxel export folder.
